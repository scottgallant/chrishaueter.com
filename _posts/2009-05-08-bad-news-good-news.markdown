I was very distracted the last two days as I anxiously awaited my MIT application decision.  After getting tired of checking my email every ten minutes, I started forwarding all of my emails to my cell phone (I had not tried it before, but it is awesome).  Well, I got a notification today:



> Dear Transfer Applicant,

I am sorry to tell you ...

Sincerely,
MIT Transfer Admissions



That was disappointing.

Nevertheless, I am already at a great institution that has many resources I'm not utilizing yet.  Hopefully I will take this failure not as a reason to give up, but as a wake-up call.  It tells me I need to study more effectively, master material better, get higher grades, and get to know my professors better.

Anyone who knows me closely can attest that I am a master of lofty goals ... and not following through with them.  Well, I'd like to change that.

_Does anyone have any suggestions?  Share them in the comments or email me._

The **good news**: I received a substantial grant that will cover my summer living expenses.  Go Columbia Undergraduate Scholars Program!

Chris
