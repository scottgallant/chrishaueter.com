Well, it's snowing here in Colorado Springs. It began yesterday evening, and has continued unabated since; it is projected to end tomorrow and be sunny and warm by Wednesday. I ventured out into the cold to take some pictures of the snowy Colorado landscape. These pictures truly do not do justice to the pristine beauty of the Springs cloaked in fluffy white. I saw some scenes later today when I was without camera that would have made a grown man cry. Okay, maybe they wouldn't have, but they sure were wonderful sights to see. Here are some of the not-so wonderful pictures anyway for your viewing pleasure.

Waves in the snow, caused by the strong wind (strong enough that I had to brace myself to take these pictures).

Snow being blown from the tops of drifts.

An interesting pattern in the slush at the edge of my driveway.

The wind was strong enough to bend tree branches such as these.

A FedEx truck traversing the slushy wilderness.

This is the same boulevard pictured in my blog [here](http://chrishaum.blogspot.com/2005/06/colorado-is-amazing.html).  What a change.

     Upward-growing ice crystals on a bush!

And finally, for contrast, some flowers I photographed only nine days earlier.
