Hmmm....  
  
I am not feeling great right now, but I am getting along.  I have been sleeping correctly (i.e. 20 min. naps in 4 hour increments) since I overslept Tuesday night.  It is kind of bitter-sweet....  I get pretty tired by nap time; the naps are getting progressively deeper and more restful, I think.  Sometimes it feels good to take a nap, but most of the time I wake up a bit groggy and moody.  
  
I have started to notice a pattern in how I fall asleep:  


  1. I lie down and get comfortable.  

  2. I realize that I am thinking too much about whatever was on my mind and try to clear my mind.  Almost every time I think, "Wow, it is taking a long time to fall asleep."  

  3. Some of my muscles begin to twitch.
  4. My breathing becomes slower and more regular, and...
  5. The next thing I know, my cell phone alarm is beeping.
It is not very enjoyable yet, still just kind of awkward and uncomfortable.  One interesting thing is that I am not getting nearly as tired as I expected I would.  It has actually been surprisingly easy to maintain this sleep schedule.  I have probably not hit the peak of the transition period yet, though.  
  
During the nights, I have mostly been doing Internet investing research and reading from books every now and then.  
  
I have also been having bursts of energy.  For example, this morning while showering I burst not only into song, but into dance, too!  I have never danced in the shower before, but it sure was fun!  
  
Around noon I went to check out a summer door-to-door sales job selling satellite TV packages.  I am strongly considering taking the job, mostly because if I work hard and effectively, I could make considerable income, which I would save for future investment.  The one catch is the schedule.  My 4 PM and 8 PM naps would conflict with my work.  The 4 PM nap would not be so critical, but 8 PM is prime time for door-to-door sales.  If I take the job, my options will be to stop the polyphasic sleeping on May 13, after exactly 30 days of the experiment, or to adjust the sleep cycle so that I take more naps at night and fewer during the day.  
  
I will probably consult some other polyphasic sleepers and get their opinions.  
  
That's it for now!  If you have questions or comments, please feel free to use the comment form below.
