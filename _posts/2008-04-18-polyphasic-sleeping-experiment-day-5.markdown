title: Polyphasic Sleeping Experiment - Day 5

Last night was the hardest night so far. I did not have anything planned in advance for the middle of the night, so the tiredness was really noticeable. I had to take an extra nap at 1 AM because I did not get any sleep at midnight (I think). It is actually really weird, but I am not always sure if I actually fall asleep or not. Upon waking, I am generally pretty disoriented for a minute or so. My naps so far today have been really good, though. I fell asleep quickly, felt like I slept for a long time, and woke up rested. It is really weird to look at my alarm and realize that it has only been 20 minutes, when it felt like an hour.  
  
In short, I have a lot of different feelings as I go about this experiment. I will stick with it and cannot wait to get past this awkward and uncomfortable transition stage. Then the benefits successful polyphasic sleepers have written about will come, like feeling energetic and rested all the time.  
  
My health seems to be only slightly out of whack.  
  
On Thursday evening I ran for about twenty minutes before ending up at the local gym's pool. At first I swam laps in the lap pool, but it was crowded, so I took a break in the hot tub. After sitting in the hot tub and talking for fifteen minutes I began to feel unwell, so I got up to walk back to the lap pool, and had a rush of blood away from my head. I had to sit down on the deck and regain vision and strength and then sat in the shallow water of the steps into the pool to get acclimated. This incident was a little disturbing to me. It happened pretty frequently before the sleep experiment, though, usually when I stand up quickly after lying down. Anyway, the weakness was probably from sleep deprivation (I'll still be in that stage for another week); it could also be related to my diet, which I am now improving.  
  
I have gotten a little bit of a throat cold, which is understandable from the stress my body is under.  
  
I have spent a lot of time today pondering, writing down my goals and the steps I must take to reach them. Hopefully this will help me to fill all this extra time better... If I cannot use the extra time effectively, I might as well not have it.  
  
I am actually going to turn the computer off now. It's about time!
