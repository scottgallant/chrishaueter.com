In reading the Harvard alumni magazine online this evening, I came upon [this](http://harvardmagazine.com/2009/11/spaced-education-boosts-learning) interesting article which discusses some of the benefits of _spaced_ _learning_, a learning technique that "can increase knowledge by up to 50 percent, and strengthen retention for up to two years."  The article links to the website of [SpacedEd,](http://www.spaceded.com) a startup that implements spaced repetition in the form of Q&A-style courses that are delivered to paying subscribers daily by email, text message, or RSS feed.

While investigating SpacedEd's site, I learned that they are seeking new courses.  In fact, they offer of a $100 [royalty advance](http://www.spaceded.com/info/advance) and 60-80% royalties for courses added to their site.  Conveniently, they also posted a list of the courses requested most often by subscribers.

I do not feel particularly interested in preparing such courses, but I am interested in hiring someone to write them for me.  So I threw together a quick job offer and posted it [here](http://manila.craigslist.com.ph/edu/1450714600.html) on Craigslist Manila.  My hope is that in the next few days someone will respond with course proposals.  I will turn around and submit them to SpacedEd.  If SpacedEd accepts them, I will pay the proposer to complete the course, which I will then turn over to SpaceEd.  In the short run, I will net $75 per course, since I am offering $25 to the course writer.  In the long run, each course should become a small source of residual income that requires little effort to maintain.  I will continue to publish updates on this experiment as it progresses.
