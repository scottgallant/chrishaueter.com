I had an eye appointment today. My eyes were dilated, and a retinal tomograph was taken of each eye. Everything was statistically normal for my demographics.  
  
I was especially pleased with the equipment and software used to generate each retinal tomograph. For each eye, I stared for a few seconds at a green dot beside a bright red laser array. The report for each eye, including measurements, charts, graphs, and a picture of each retina in the region of the optic nerve, was generated automatically and stored in my personal medical records. The next time I have the same examination done, the software will compare my previous results with the new ones, and statistically compare the progression to demographic norms to diagnose further. It even renders a 3D version of my retina, which can be zoomed in, rotated, etc.  
  
Wow!  
Such cool software!

Here is the description of the HRT3, the new model of Retinal Tomograph (the HRT2 was used at my air base hospital), found at [http://www.heidelbergengineering.com](http://www.heidelbergengineering.com/):  
  


**Heidelberg**** Engineering Launches HRT3 to Facilitate **

 

**Early Glaucoma Diagnosis **

 

_New Device is Portable, Easy to Use and Can Analyze Glaucoma Progression_

 

**DOSSENHEIM****, GERMANY**** Sept. 1, 2005 ** Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, the leading developer of laser diagnostics for ophthalmic applications, announced today the introduction of the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 3 (HRT3), a newly-enhanced version of its flagship product for the assessment, diagnosis and management of glaucoma. 

 

Like its predecessor, the HRT3 uses laser technology to produce a topographical image of a patient's optic nerve, providing an objective analysis of the structure's cup, rim and retinal nerve fiber layer. Optic disc topography has been found to be predictive of visual field loss according to a long term study published in the Journal of Glaucoma. 

 

Heidelberg Engineering has incorporated several new features in the HRT3 in direct response to customer feedback. These include the Fast Check Glaucoma Probability Score, which is generated using an advanced form of artificial intelligence called a relevance vector machine. This sophisticated analysis provides a statistical probability of glaucoma using ethnic-specific databases. In addition, the software eliminates the need to draw contour lines or use reference planes and provides real-time feedback to assist the operator in acquiring a quality image. 

 

"Optic disc assessment is more important than visual field loss as the earliest indicator of glaucoma," said Dr. Gerhard Zinser, managing director and head of R&D for Heidelberg Engineering. "For more than 10 years, optometrists and ophthalmologists have been using the HRT to analyze optic discs producing a wealth of longitudinal data. This data is confirming the role of our technology in early glaucoma detection."

 

The HRT3 monitors the patient's condition over time, comparing baseline images to follow-up examinations and highlighting areas of statistically significant progression. Monitoring progression is important in determining the course of treatment. The HRT3 is a portable, laptop-based system that can be placed in a compact carrying case. Heidelberg Engineering expects to begin shipping the new product in the last quarter of the year.
