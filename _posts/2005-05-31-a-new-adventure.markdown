I graduated on May 21 from the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Science, and the Arts. On May 23, my family and I arrived in Colorado Springs, Colorado. My father and younger brother had moved to the area in December, when my father began teaching German at the Air Force Academy. I had stayed in Hot Springs, AR to finish high school there.

In late August, I will be flying to New York to begin my studies at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University. Currently I plan on studying applied math and mechanical engineering perhaps I will major in applied math and minor in mechanical engineering.

I was chosen to be a C. Prescott Davis Scholars, one of the top 25 of the 1000 incoming SEAS freshman. I don't care for the glory or such, but I really do appreciate the practical aspects of being a CP Davis Scholar. For one, it caused the finacial aid office to give me a full-tuition grant, minus expected family contribution per FAFSA. I'll also get to attend special dinners and lectures by important people from outside of Columbia, which will assist in building connections. The Scholars office generally devotes special attention to the scholars, making Columbia life and studies that much more fulfilling.

So I'm in Colorado Springs, Colorado, looking for an internship, and doing other things until I get one. Like scanning things...

Flowers, for example:

Yup, fun times. I can post MUCH higher-res photographs, if anyone wants them.

Cheers!
