  1. Have Facebook friends.

	
  2. Pick one of the hottest google search trends from here: [Google Hot Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends)

	
  3. Mention one of the trends in a Facebook profile post linking back to your blog, e.g. "How Emily Maynard Would Get People To Read Your Blog (http://chrishaueter.com)". _Ideally, the linked page somehow mentions Emily Maynard._

	
  4. Watch the real-time data on your Google Analytics account to see the views roll in.

	
  5. Realize that untargeted views have zero economic value.

	
  6. Go to bed.
