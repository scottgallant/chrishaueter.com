I'll keep this one short because I've got a date in five minutes.  
  
I overslept this morning because I had nothing to do.  I will not do this again.  I WILL finish the experiment.  I like polyphasic sleeping.  The key is just having something to do from midnight to 8 AM.  
  
I feel really good, but I have slept normally three nights in row, so that explains it.  
  
For all those who are considering trying this sleep cycle, I give you this advice:  
  
Before beginning, have  a long list of things you would like to do during the wee hours of the night.  
  
I am not tired when I am busy with some task; only when I have nothing to do does it become unmanageable.  
  
Chris
