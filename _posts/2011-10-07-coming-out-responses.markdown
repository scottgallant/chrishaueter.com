I've received nearly 100 responses since telling the world  (well, at least the part of it that pays attention to my Facebook status updates) that I experience same-gender attraction.

Most of the responses I've gotten have been supportive and reassuring, such as this one from my friend Cecilia:

> 
> 
> Much love to you, Chris! I respect and admire your courage and strength.
>

And this from Austin:

> 
> 
> Chris, you're a champion. This is a courageous statement to make and a very important voice to add to the conversation. I am positive you will be a help to many people that either struggle with this issue personally or those (like me) in and out of the church who are trying to understand how it all fits together.

And this one from Ryan:

> 
> 
> I'm glad to see your confidence that there is (and ever will be) a place for you within the church. I know my short time with you in church wouldn't have been as fulfilling had you chosen not to attend. The church needs you and more Chris Haueters!
>

And this short and sweet comment from Mary Alice:

> 
> 
> God bless you Chris!
>

To all of my friends and acquaintances who have expressed their love and support, thank you! :)

The  most touching response came from my parents:

Thanks, Mom and Dad! I love you, too. :) <3
