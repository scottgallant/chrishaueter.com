I've created a new website:


# **[Goal Helper](http://www.goalhelper.net)**


For now it is simply a WordPress blog with one post, the main point of which is to link to a survey.  This survey, and the method I am using to get people to complete the survey, are the really interesting aspects of this project.

In short: **Amazon Mechanical Turk**.

It's a game-changer for market research, marketing, and product development.  I'll discuss this later in my next blog entry, but for now I just want to share some preliminary results of my market research, data that was obtained using Mechanical Turk and a Google Docs form.

This data is _very_ preliminary, but I am expecting another 60 survey responses in the next few days.  I'll keep you posted.
