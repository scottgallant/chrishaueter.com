Here's news:

I imported all of the posts from my old Blogspot site, chrishaum.blogspot.com, so they are now all nice and accessible in one convenient location (i.e. the 'archives' bar on the right).

The hacker theme got boring quickly, so we'll see if this theme sticks.

If you are interested, feel free to peruse the archives.  I was really into photography from May 2005 to January 2006, _unique_ photography.

I'm off to bed now, but I'll be back soon with the latest and greatest things from my life.  :)
