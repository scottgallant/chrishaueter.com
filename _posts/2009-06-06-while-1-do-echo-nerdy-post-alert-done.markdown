For the uninitiated, the linux command "sudo rm -rf /" means, "as root user, forcedly and recursively delete from the root directory," or in other words, completely destroy your operating system.  Don't worry.  Reading my blog will neither destroy your OS, nor require working knowledge of the command line.... unless I convince you to install Ubuntu.

Come on, do it already.  Open-source, free, stable, intuitive, reliable.  Did I mention free?

As far as the blog is concerned, I got tired of the previous theme, so I went with something more... plaintext.

In other news, the summer internship is going great because it gives me opportunites to program - a delight indeed.  I am looking for ideas, though:

Does anyone have any suggestions for software I could attempt to write to improve my programming skills while simutaneously making something really cool?

Share in the comments, please.
