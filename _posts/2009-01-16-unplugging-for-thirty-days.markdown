I had the idea this morning to try a little experiment. For thirty days I am going to find alternate ways to spend my time. Here are the details of my experiment:



	
  * I will check my email twice a day, for no longer than twenty minutes at a time, including writing any email responses.

	
  * I will also write updates occasionally on this blog (perhaps once per week, if that), spending no more than thirty minutes.

	
  * No RSS feeds (good night, Google Reader).

	
  * No Facebook.

	
  * No Youtube.

	
  * No reading blogs.

	
  * No etc.


Well, that's about it. Class resumes on Tuesday, so I will have plenty to do. I'll keep you updated on the experiment as it progresses.

Also, has anyone reading this tried cutting back on computer use? Perhaps it has never been a distraction for you? Please share your opinions and comments below.
