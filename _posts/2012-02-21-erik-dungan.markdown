## Full Transcript


Chris: Welcome, viewers, to chrishaueter.com. Today, I am excited to be interviewing Erik Dungan. Erik, welcome.

Erik: Hello. Thanks for having me.

Chris: Pleasure. So I'm excited to interview Erik because he is a very successful entrepreneur. Let me just share with you his biography a little bit. You started a company called "Teaching View", which was an educational web application, right?

Erik: Yeah, correct.

Chris: Which you sold to Comevo in 2004.

Erik: Yeah.

Chris: In 2002, you started BIG Folio, a website for photographers, which you launched in 2003 and has been profitable each year since then.

Erik: Correct.

Chris: You launched NextProof in 2008 and APhotoFolio in 2008, both of those are photography websites and they both have been profitable and growing each year.

Erik: Yeah. NextProof is sort of separate product that's part of BIG Folio. APhotoFolio we started as a separate company because I had a third cofounder there. It's very similar to BIG Folio but it's aimed at a different segment of the professional photography community. BIG Folio and NextProof are really aimed at the wedding and portrait photography segment. APhotoFolio is more aimed at the high-end commercial and fashion and editorial folks, so a different crowd.

Chris: And we're going to get into the details of each of those businesses and how you chose those. Just to give everyone a sense of the level of Erik's success, each of those, BIG Folio and APhotoFolio, have several thousand clients and are running revenues in the low millions per year.

Erik: Correct.

Chris: So, very profitable, I assume. Well, revenues, I assume they're profitable businesses as well.

Erik: They are. They are profitable, yeah.

Chris: Okay. You recently started a new business, Cilantro, which is one aspect of your new foray into restaurants and small business services.

Erik: Correct.

Chris: Okay. Let's go back to the beginning. Back when you were working at a community college, you started teaching here. Why don't you tell us, first, what was that business?

Erik: So I was going to school and working at a community college. I ended up getting a job in a computer lab and kind of got promoted up to a special projects and IT programmer person and, basically, I did a couple projects for the school. This is like '98, '99 so the web was around but it was very early web 1.0 days. I did some on-line projects for school. If anyone knows how fast schools move, they don't.

It was kind of a big deal back then so the Dean that I worked under would kind of show these projects off to meeting and for those who aren't in California, the California college system has over 100 schools, so it's actually a really big system. These other community colleges would see some of the projects I did and want the same thing. I couldn't really do them while being paid for the college I worked for.

So my friend, who became my cofounder at the time, we decided, "Hey, let's just do something for some other schools in our off hours." We did and that's kind of how it started. Basically, colleges and universities, they have to go through kind of a matriculation and orientation process so we built a little template and system so schools could do orientation and new student instruction on the web, as opposed to having to come onto campus for certain things.

Chris: Ultimately, when you sold that business in 2004, right?&acirc;€&uml;

Erik: I think that's right, yeah.

Chris: How successful was it by the point you sold it?

Erik: I would say it was maybe moderately successful at best. The thing with working with a big institution like a school is that they have really slow sales cycles. We had kind of an annual contract business model so they would pay us maybe $5,000-10,000 per year to use this system.

Chris: How many schools were you able to sell during these years?

Erik: I think a few dozen. As far as revenue and success, it was profitable but it was just the two of us. It wasn't a lot of growth. Like I was saying, with a school, it takes, literally, three to six months to get from an interested school to actually a signature on a contract and a check. It's not like the SaaS businesses that everyone in the start-up community is used to these days where people just enter a credit card online and they're up and running. Personally, it would probably be the least successful thing I've done but it paid the bills for a few years. I was eventually able to quit my last full-time job.

Chris: Okay. Based on the growth of this business alone?

Erik: Sure.

Chris: And when you sold it in 2004, at that point, were you able to retire at that time? Would you have been able to but chose to continue working?

Erik: No, no.

Chris: It wasn't big enough for a . . .

Erik: No, we actually, in the first couple years of the company, we took out a traditional SBA loan from a bank so when we sold it, it was more a matter of we were selling it to free up time to work on the new business. It was able to pay off our loan as well as put a chunk of money in each of our bank accounts to save and stock away.

Chris: Okay.

Erik: But definitely not retirement.

Chris: Let's go on to BIG Folio. You started it in 2002. It was growing while you were still working on teaching here in 2004. First of all, how did you even get the idea for BIG Folio?

Erik: Well, I had a friend that I went to church with at the time who was a wedding photographer. He knew I was sort of a technology web guy so he asked me to hack together a website for him once so I just did it as a favor. I'm sure that most people that know HTML have had similar experiences like that. So the thing was, a wedding photographer, if they're a full-time person, they're shooting weddings almost every weekend so every week or two he would come back to me and say, "Hey, I need you to upload these pictures from this recent wedding because . . . " He was a fairly new photographer so each week you're shooting, you're, hopefully, getting better so you want to put your best images up there. And, frankly, it was just annoying.

At the time, I was pretty much a PHP and flash guys so I sort of hacked together this real simple CMS and PHP. There were some CMS's out there, but this was before WordPress or at least before WordPress version 1. I just hacked something together myself and I showed him how to use it and he was just ecstatic about it because he could go in and do it himself. He said, "You know, you should really try and sell this to some other people. So I kind of hacked together a website for the corporate side and my cofounder, he, I'm not proud of it, but he basically just scoured the Internet for photographers in California and basically just spammed them all, initially.

Chris: Now, when you say that, do you mean that he built the website and then sent the same e-mail to all of them?

Erik: No, no, no.

Chris: Person by person.

Erik: Person by person, yeah.

Chris: Okay. It's funny that you say that but that's currently how I'm growing this business. I find successful entrepreneurs and . . .

Erik: Yeah. I think it was just fortuitous for us because it happened to be . . . This is still 10 years ago so still kind of the web 1.0 days but it was also when the real initial shift of film to digital photography was happening. Digital cameras had been around but they were just then getting to the level that a professional could get to a similar quality as what they could with film. We just hit it at the right time. There was only one or two other small companies doing websites for photographers at the time. We happened to hit it at a good time. A couple other people my partner e-mailed ended up being really well-known photographers and that gave us a big boost as well. It literally took off faster than we could get a payment system set up and start building out features.

Chris: So once you started e-mail marketing and just sharing with a few friends, the marketing was basically viral.

Erik: Yeah.

Chris: Did you invest anything else in marketing?

Erik: No. It was a good two years before we started running ads online. Eventually, we did that as well as doing some industry trade shows so those are our main marketing avenues now. Initially, it was all word of mouth.

Chris: Okay. So why did you start advertising? Did word of mouth dry up?

Erik: No, not at all. We just like to experiment with different things. The thing I've always liked about working in kind of a niche industry is that it's very easy to target your customers. For photography, for example, it's very easy to find things like forums for specific professional photographers and then advertise there, as opposed to just blasting ads everywhere on the Internet. That's one thing I always have found. I guess why I'm drawn to these niche industries because it's really easy to target your market and, obviously, add on-line ad technology has advanced over the last six, eight years as well.

Chris: Would you say that is a decisive factor in the success of these businesses?

Erik: Is the online advertising?

Chris: That you've focused on specific niches and, therefore, can advertise cheaply and effectively.

Erik: It's definitely one of the biggest benefits and I guess, me personally, working in these niches is kind of what is really the only thing that I've experienced. I don't have experience doing a big consumer Internet play or a big VC-backed start-up. I'm sure each has its ups and downs but from the niche things that I've done, I've found that's definitely one of the big pluses.

Chris: So, with BIG Folio, you were sort of one of the first players in that space who was pretty easy to get traction, what challenges and obstacles did you encounter?

Erik: Challenges and obstacles, up until, I'd say, the first four years, the biggest challenge for me was just working on my own personal skills and especially my ability to stay organized and focused on just keeping things rolling and updated and getting done. I'd say probably one thing I waited a long time too long to do was to be comfortable with outsourcing, doing things to either other services or other employees, things like sysadmin with regards to servers. We host all our sites on dedicated boxes so I guess I would always try to do everything myself and over commit myself in terms of time and stuff like that and that would cause deadlines to slip and problems to happen here and there.

Business-wise, it always was just a nice, steady growth up for the first several years, I'd say, until the economy in 2008 kind of took a dive, we didn't run into too many issues. Competitors popped up and things like that but, for the most part, it was pretty smooth growth. The main issues were just learning how to become a founder of a company of more than just two people once you start hiring employees, learning how to manage that and delegate tasks to different team members or your freelance people that you use, stuff like that.

Chris: And how many employees does BIG Folio have now?

Erik: I think Folio we have six full-time people and then three part-time contractor people that are working for us right now. I have a guy that does just servers admin but he does it part-time, which is enough. Most of our servers are managed through space so with the stuff that space give us, plus him, that's pretty much allowed me to be hands off with regard to sysadmin, which is really nice.

Chris: Are you the lead, like, the CTO? Do you still have an active role in programming?

Erik: Yeah. I write code everyday. I have another developer who does most of the PHP and action script stuff for the Flash-based things that we have. But I still code in Rails and JavaScript everyday.

Chris: Over time, you said, you were able to delegate more. So you have another developer but how are you now about delegating? Are you comfortable with delegating or is it still sort of a pain point for you?

Erik: Yeah, very comfortable, very comfortable. I know as long as I'm confident in the person and I try my best not to hire people that I wouldn't be confident in. Yeah, I think that balance is, I guess, delegating, but also I still like to have a say in the final decisions on certain things like, "We should do this a certain way," or "We shouldn't do this a certain way." But, yeah, in terms of just being comfortable delegating stuff, definitely. As long as you trust your people, that's not a problem at all.

Chris: Let's see. So, after BIG Folio, you launched NextProof in 2008.

Erik: Yeah, that sounds right. Sorry. It's fun getting old.

Chris: How did you get the idea for NextProof, in the first place?

Erik: Basically, it was something our customers that we had at the time kept requesting. BIG Folio sort of allowed these wedding photographers to build their portfolio, kind of, what their potential customers would see but then on the other side of a wedding, now that we're in the digital world, photographers shoot a wedding and then they want to upload it and sell the prints to the bride and the guests at the wedding.

At the time, in '07, '08, there was already a few companies that did this and some of them were really big, investment backed companies, but their quality wasn't there and they have kind of a bad reputation in terms of customer service and things like that. We, on the other hand, we'd always done a really good job with our customer support. We kind of pride ourselves in that and we always have, being among the best support in the industry and that's why we get a lot of referral business, word of mouth and have a really good retention rate.

A lot of our customers kept saying, "I really wish you would sell a proofing or an e-commerce product because I don't like the way that x does things," or, "I don't like this other company." It had been at least a year or two that people requested it so we finally broke down and built it. So that's basically what NextProof is. It lets these wedding and portrait photographers upload prints, set the prices, and I would kind of compare it, if people know what Shopify is, it's kind of like a Shopify for wedding photographers.

Chris: Are these separate companies or do you have a portfolio company that has all the employees or do you have separate employees for each product?

Erik: If you're talking about legal, corporate structure . . .

Chris: No, just from a management perspective.

Erik: Management-wise, NextProof and BIG Folio are the same six employees. Our support staff supports both products, the websites and the proofing e-commerce stuff. Our developers, they're kind of split. I work on NextProof and this new HTML5 product we have. I other developed or worked on the BIG Folio side, which is, actually, different technology. It's the PHP and Flash stuff but a good amount of JavaScript in HTML as well. Those two blend together pretty well.

Chris: And how about APhotoFolio?

Erik: That's, actually, a totally separate company where we've got one, two, five other employees. So what happened was I became friends with Rob Haggart, who was a magazine editor and then became a blogger in the photo industry. I teamed up with him and we formed APhotoFolio as, basically, a totally separate company that kind of took some of the core technology of BIG Folio and made a slightly different product aimed at these high-end commercial photographers. Because Rob, he's the CEO of that company and because he's a fairly well-know person in the industry that that company has taken off and done real well on its own.

Chris: Was that also bootstrapped?

Erik: Yep, absolutely.

Chris: So every one of your businesses has been bootstrapped, is that right?

Erik: Yep. So far.

Chris: Do you have plans for anything VC-backed?

Erik: I apply to YCombinator every term and get turned down. It's not something I really care either way.

Chris: It's funny that they would turn you down every term considering that track record.

Erik: Well, yeah. Usually it's because I have so many other things so it's understandable that they want people who can, kind of, laser-focus on stuff for awhile. Although, I've gotten good feedback from people at YCombinator there. I actually was a finalist at the Tech Stars Seattle pool last year as well but I think it was probably better that I didn't make it at the end there.

Chris: Are you the sole owner of any of these companies?

Erik: No, I have cofounders in both BIG Folio and APhotoFolio. I'm the sole owner of kind of this new stuff that I'm kind of pursuing with regard to the restaurant and small business space.

Chris: It sounds like with revenues in the low millions per year, several thousand clients for BIG Folio and APhotoFolio and with you being co-owner, bootstrapped, it sounds like you could retire at this point, if you wanted too.

Erik: Probably. I guess technically, yeah. The companies have a good amount of recurring revenue that we can kind of guarantee on and things like that so I suppose, if I wanted to hire someone to replace what I do in terms of coding and whatnot, I could kind of sit back and live off my ownership but that sounds kind of boring.

Chris: Okay. So you do it out of passion, that's why you're continuing to work and build these businesses.

Erik: Yeah. I love building things and solving problems and doing start-ups and things like that.

Chris: Very cool. Why don't you share about Cilantro? What is it? How did you get the idea?

Erik: Well, I guess, for the last six, eight years doing websites for a specific industry, I've done and been moderately successful at. One of my passions is traveling and eating out. Frankly, at some point last year, I got really sick of restaurant websites because they're usually in Flash, which it's ironic that I say that because I've made a really successful business building Flash websites, but I don't think they're appropriate for a restaurant. They're usually in Flash and then usually the menu's in a PDF format and when my wife and I are out traveling and we want to find a restaurant and I try to pull something up on my phone, it's usually a big fail.

It was just a side project at the time and kind of hacked together. I called it kind of an "About.me", if people are familiar with that, for restaurants. Sort of a real nice, single page, scrolling site that had all the essential information, basically what I would want a restaurant to have if I went there. I built that and I ran some Google ads just to get some validation on the idea once I had the MVP out of it. I got a good amount of sign-ups. Figured out where the hang-ups were, where the problems with it were, what it needed. Just for my own, I guess, needs going forward, I formed just an LLC out of it and I'm kind of exploring other tools for restaurants and small businesses. Feedback so far has been good.

Chris: Going back to your initial market validation, which you did through pay-per-click ads, was that profitable from the outset or was there a large outlay that you made investing in that research?

Erik: It wasn't profitable, mainly because I was offering it for free, initially. I was running like a $25 a day budget through Ad Words so I was getting a good amount of sign-ups everyday but I wasn't charging them at the time. I'm going to actually roll that out in the next week or so, so it was basically to make a free site, free restaurant kind of thing.

Chris: Have you done that before where you started with free to validate the market and then change it into a paid product?

Erik: We do a freemium model at NextProof so there is a free plan where you can get a small amount of space and some limited features for free. This is the first time that I've done free, basically, only free just for market validation. I had never really done it like this before, no.

Chris: Once you got customers signing up, what other steps were involved in that validation process? How did you get their feedback?

Erik: Usually, I, basically, the first week, I manually just e-mail them just because I want it to be genuine and personal and just say, "Hey, you're like the fourth person that signed up. Are you really looking for a website or are you just kind of playing around? Is there anything you like or don't like about it?" Stuff like that. Eventually, I used, what is it, KISSnsights from the KISSmetrics people to do kind of a pop-up survey inside the system when they're logged in. Then I run, basically, sort of newsletter, sort of, campaigns and invite feedback through MailChimp or whatnot.

Chris: I'd like to dive more into those points. KISSInsights, how effective has that been in getting feedback compared to the direct e-mail?&acirc;€&uml;

Erik: I think they're both effective. I use KISSInsights over at BIG Folio now too and it's nice because we pop it up just for normal visitors and we say, "Hey, did you find out the information you were looking for." It's surprising when 50% of the people say no, it's surprising and makes you take a step back and makes you think, "Wow. Maybe this page isn't as awesome as I though it was." It's interesting when you learn that even though you're selling product that you might be leaving money on the table because some people aren't getting the information they need.

Then after, when you do it also with your people after they sign up, it's effective too. I think the best thing is it really helps you find inefficiencies in your processes or your software itself. It's nice because you find something and you fix it and it has sort of the double effect of making your product better and more worthy of a referral but it also takes a load off your support team so it kind of doubles down there.

Chris: Not to mention that I'm sure it increases revenue.

Erik: Correct.

Chris: How does that compare with, say, split testing?

Erik: I guess they're just different things. Split testing is more of a statistical thing as opposed to getting subjective feedback from people.

Chris: Would you say that the subjective feedback is easier to implement or more useful than the [inaudible 31:23] testing?

Erik: It's easier when you see that multiple people saying, like I mentioned at BIG Folio, we require that if you get a site from us that we host it. We charge a monthly fee for that. So when you have 12 people over a month tell you that they didn't know that or they couldn't find out that information, then that's kind of a no-brainer that that's something you have to fix and make more clear. Whereas A/B testing is, and I'm sure I'll get some comments that I'm not correct or I'm not being complete, but in my experience, A/B testing is more for determining the most effective layout or information with regards to converting visitors into customers.

Chris: Okay. So would you agree that KISSInsights then has been more useful for learning from your existing customers as opposed to learning from potential customers?

Erik: I would say both. Maybe it's because I'm so busy, I don't have a lot of time to put into tons of multivariate A/B tests. I just like that you can get this answer of, "I was looking for this info and it wasn't there," versus an A/B test where you have to sort of guess that either A or B is going to be effective, when, in fact, neither one can be because they might be looking for C. I'm sure the best answer would be a combination of those but I like interacting with customers on a one-to-one basis when I can and getting their feedback.

We launched a new product, sort of like a BIG Folio, but kind of a lighter HTML5-only version without Flash. We've had sort of a waiting list while we built it and launched it in beta and now that we've had a couple hundred people sign up, it's nice to personally, myself, interact with some of the first users and get their feedback. I don't think that's something that I could get with just A/B testing.

Chris: So I'm going to transition now. I'd like to know more about you, the person. What is your average workday like?

Erik: Okay. First of all, I'm not a morning person. I don't get up early. I get up at 7:30 in the morning because I take my two girls that are in school to school. I've found that 7:30's the latest I can sleep in and still get them to school in time. I prep breakfast and lunches the night before, get up, get a shower, get the kids off to school and then, generally, I'll head to one of my coffee shops, grab an [AmErikano] and then head to the office. We're actually in between offices right now so I'm working from my little home office.

Usually, I actually try to get one thing done in the morning before I even open my e-mail so, usually, whatever I was working on the day before, or the Friday before if it was a Monday, I'll try to actually finish that and if it involves deploying code, I'll try to actually deploy something before I even open my e-mail because I know once I open my e-mail, then I'll usually end up with three or four or five new things that I have to take care of. I don't know.

Like I said in the past, for me, I don't know, being a little ADD and whatnot, I find that's the best way for me to make sure I have, even if the rest of the day goes to heck because a server crashed or some major issue popped up, at least I know I've got one thing figured out. Of course, if there's an emergency, I'm going to get a phone call or a text message about it so I'll jump to that.

Chris: So what does it look like after you get one thing done, you open up the e-mail, say there are no emergencies, does that happen?

Erik: Yeah, once, once every few weeks. Then if there's anything in e-mail that's pressing, I try to do a kind of modified GTD where if it's something that I can get done or answered in a couple minutes, I'll do that. Otherwise, I'll add it to my list of to-do's and try to prioritize there. Then, mainly, the rest of the day, I'm spending coding on whatever main product or feature or bug fix we've got going on, coordinating with my other developers, usually I'll take some time almost everyday to glance at my analytics and my KISSmetrics and my KISSInsights and my numbers of how many people are doing demos and see what sales are like for the day and the week, as the week goes on, things like that.

Chris: And that's basically the rest of your day?

Erik: That's my day, yeah. I've probably spend maybe half a day per week just hacking on something experimental or just playing around with some new thing I found on Hacker News or something like that. Yeah, I'd probably say maybe 10% of my time I try to do something like that. It helps me sort of take a break. I don't think a start-up should be married too closely to one technology so I always try to, whether it's to learn a new language or play with a new JavaScript framework or just mess around, experiment, it's nice.

Chris: I've been playing around with the Twitter Bootstrap recently. I think it's awesome.

Erik: Yeah, yeah. I use it quite a bit lately. Although upgrading, I had a project I upgraded it from version 1.0 to 2.0 was a lot of find and replace stuff in there in terms of class names and whatnot. It's a great little project. Very cool of Twitter to put that out there.

Chris: How many hours would you say you work a week on average?

Erik: I'd say probably 50 at the most. Now that I'm in my 30's, I can work through the night late maybe once a week but mainly, because I have a family, I've got four kids, when I come home, I try not to really do much work stuff once I get home. Also because I'm the cook of the family so everyone would starve anyway. But maybe once a week, if I need to get something cranked out or I just want to mess around, I might open the laptop up in the evening after people are in bed but for the most part, I work pretty sane hours.

Chris: How well does your method of working and entrepreneur route you've taken, how well does that support your lifestyle? I mean, I know some people just want to work as little as possible and they're fine with not earning a lot of money because it gives them freedom and flexibility, for example?

Erik: Yeah, I mean, I make, I guess, I make more money than I need right now, which is just is what it is, I guess. We live well below our means and we have pretty, I don't know what the term is, pretty normal lifestyle in terms of things we buy and whatnot. Like I said, I like to travel so I take time off here and there. We'll take weekend trips with the family and do things so I probably spend more money doing that kind of stuff than the average person but for the most part, the business has been good to me, been a blessing to me. If something happened and the economy or the business and things went south, it's nice knowing I have marketable skills if I ever had to go get a real job and have a boss. Hopefully that won't happen anytime soon but if something did happen, my lifestyle wouldn't change drastically. We don't have any debt, which is also nice so it's cool.

Chris: Yeah, I mean, I would say that's probably one of the greatest assets of not taking the traditional university route. Although you've said you completed all but one semester of your degree.

Erik: Yeah. I'm still a senior, a 36 year-old senior.

Chris: Yeah. A lot of people, especially people who go to Ivy League schools, and not even Ivy League schools but big state schools, lots of great name schools, they come out with tens of thousands of dollars in debt. So it's relay prohibitive of them. They can't take on as much risk starting their own business.

Erik: Right. No, absolutely. I admire a lot of things about people who have gone to top tier schools like that and finish their degree and things but I think that's one thing that's good and we didn't do it by choice. We didn't buy a house when the housing bubble was in effect, which, we had a lot of friends who did and that kind of came back to bite them. I did have some student loans that are pretty much paid off, well, they are paid off. Yeah, I know what you mean. Some things like that can really, not necessarily, stop you from being an entrepreneur but it can definitely have an effect on your mindset and being able to focus on things.

Chris: Definitely. So I'd say that you are programmer at heart, but also a business person. There's lots of great programmers who aren't good at business, so how do you manage to do both well?

Erik: Well, like I said, I have cofounders, so for the most part, they take care of a lot of the business aspects but it's interesting, I feel like over the last few years, really, you can almost be like a hacker programmer and run a business yourself without having to have a non-technical cofounder. I think a lot of that's due to all these services and things that are very effective in, basically, taking a load off the non-technical aspects of a business, whether it be accounting or marketing and analytics stuff and things like that. You look at services like FreshBooks or inDinero or things that help you manage all your bookkeeping and stuff. That's huge for one or two guys who are just hackers and want to start a business, stetting that up and not having to worry about keeping your books or your taxes in order, being able to have kind of fairly automatic sales and marketing channels, things like that.

Chris: So you mentioned FreshBooks and inDinero, what would help you to have fairly automatic marketing channels? I mean, pay-per-click clearly, but is there something else?

Erik: No, I mean, pay-per-click stuff, probably the main thing that I was referring to. Obviously, there's Google in that realm and Facebook. I don't find Facebook too effective for most businesses in terms of ads. There's other services like BuySellAds where you can target your ads to specific sites and blogs and things like that. But you don't really need a, I don't know, at least initially when you're starting out a small software company, you don't need a marketing department or a sales team and things like that, at least in my experience, from my aspect of looking at niche B-to-B start-ups.

Chris: So with Cilantro you've taken this approach, the sole programmer, marketer, outsourcing the business side, using these tools to meet the needs on the marketing an business side.

Erik: Correct.

Chris: What's the growth looking like for Cilantro?

Erik: Good, good. We, I mean I, I shouldn't say "we", the website stuff is still doing sign-ups. I started building out some tools for social media so that the restaurant could build out a Facebook page and sell their own Groupon-like daily deals from their Facebook page with a Stripe account and actually just signed up my first paying client for that so that's promising. But, yeah, to answer your question, I'm trying to do it without any non-technical people doing that kind of stuff and I'm using inDinero for accounting. The one thing I think that is still necessary that a technical person will need to sort of get over and do is literally getting outside and talking to your target market.

For example, with that, walk downtown in San Luis Obispo here where I am and walk into restaurants and started talking to owners about what they need, what they don't need. And I don't think that's something that's ever going to change. If you're going to build a start-up that's going to create value, you're going to have to find out what people need and what their pain points are. Obviously, for some businesses, for some things, you can do that on-line but a lot of times it's nice to get physically into a store and talk to someone.

Chris: Going back to the point about solo versus partnership starting, having a cofounder or not, what would have been the advantages you've seen of having a cofounder and the disadvantages?

Erik: I'd say the advantages are you have another person there to give a different point of view. You have someone there to, in theory, pick you up when you're down and vice versa. When you're in that sort of trough of despair or that time when things are slow and you don't know it it's going to work, ideally, you would encourage one another out of that or through that. One person can't always do everything. It's nice to have complementary skill sets whether it's technical, non-technical or just different types of technical. The downside is a business partnership is not unlike a marriage so there's a lot of give and take and sacrifice and trust required. That can go good or bad sometimes.

Chris: Yeah. I mean, I understand that you still have these partners, so I can see why you'd be uncomfortable to share details of challenges.

Erik: Oh, yeah. I mean, I don't think there's any set of business partners that have been in business for any time that haven't had their moments and their knock-down drag-out fights and I'm no different there.

Chris: So going forward, you've started your own business with Cilantro, is that something you're going to do again?

Erik: After Cilantro?

Chris: Yeah, is this a new trend for you?

Erik: No. Even now I have some friends who are sort of assisting me with some of the aspects of Cilantro and the other restaurant products I'm building so I may eventually take on some cofounders. We'll see how it goes. So far it's promising but I don't know. I try not to plan too much into the future because when I do it never turns out how I want. I kind of stay focused on what I've got going now and plan out a little bit but I think that if, right now, I tried to even think about, let alone, take on any other projects, it'd probably just be too much and I wouldn't get anything done.

Chris: Well, before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to share with the audience of entrepreneurs here at chrishaueter.com?

Erik: No. I mean, it's been a pleasure. I'm thinking about some of the things in talking to you. I'm sure you can post my Twitter e-mail in the show notes so if anyone has questions or wants to pick my brain about anything, I'm always available.

Chris: Absolutely. Well, thank you for the interview.

Erik: Thanks, Chris, appreciate it.
