The time has come. In fewer than six days, I will be on an airplane headed for Salt Lake City, Utah. From there I will take a shuttle to Provo, where I will enter the Missionary Training Center. After 9-12 weeks at the MTC, I will fly to Ukraine.  
  
Following is my contact information while at the MTC and later in Ukraine.  
  
While at the Provo, Utah MTC (until early April 2006):  


  
  * No phone or email.  Only mail correspondence:

Provo Missionary Training Center  
2005 N 900 E  
Provo, UT 84604

  
  * You can also use dearelder.com for free. Just select "Provo MTC" as the mission, rather than "Ukraine Donetsk." See below for details.  

While in Ukraine (April 2006 - Feb. 2008):  
  
Email:  


  
  * Please feel free to email me at chrishaum@gmail.com.
  
  * I will not be able to respond via email, so
  
  * include your postal mailing address so I may respond by post.
Phone:  


  
  * Nope.  No calls.  Sorry!  However, I would love to talk to you when I return to the U.S. in early 2008.
Mail:  


  
  1. The easiest (and free) way is through [www.dearelder.com](http://www.dearelder.com/index/inc_name/mission_selection). Select "Ukraine Donetsk" from the drop-down list, and click the "Write a Missionary" button. Enter your name and return address and address the letter to Elder Chris Haueter. Enter your email address and mine. Then type (or copy and paste) your letter in the box and press "Send Letter." They will print the letter and put it in the pouch that my Church delivers weekly to my mission headquarters.  
  

  
  2. Send the letter directly to the pouch service.  
 Warning: Please do not include anything but documents in your letter, or else the Church and I will get in trouble with the government of Ukraine. For example, paper prints/copies of photographs are OK, while original photos are not.  


> Elder Christopher Matthew Haueter  
Ukraine Donetsk Mission  
P.O. Box 30150  
Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0150

  
  3. Mail packages to the mission headquarters.  For small packages of nominal value, the USPS will suffice.  
 Warning: Clothing, food products, and other "dutiable merchandise" may not arrive intact or arrive at all. I may also be charged customs duties to receive dutiable items.

Ukraine

That is about it.  Please keep in touch!  I would love to be kept up-to-date on the lives of my friends.  
  
Cheers,  
Elder Haueter  


> **What is the pouch mail program?**  
The Church has established the Pouch Mail program to help families to communicate better with their missionaries in countries with poor mail systems. When you mail your letters to the Pouch Mail Department in Salt Lake City, the Church places all the letters bound for one mission in a big package and ships them to the mission through an express carrier service. When the letters arrive at the mission office in the destination country, the office Elders open the package of letters and distribute them to the Elders and Sisters throughout the mission.  
  
**How does DearElder.com work with the pouch mail department to get letters to the missionaries?  
** The Pouch Department only sends one package per week to each mission. In order for your letter to go out in a certain week's package, the letter must reach the Salt Lake City Pouch Mail Department by 5:00pm on Friday.  
In order for DearElder.com to get your letter to the Pouch Mail Department by Friday at 5:00pm, we require you to submit your letter by Thursday at 12:00pm (MST). The Pouch Mail Department doesn't actually mail your letters until the following Tuesday.
