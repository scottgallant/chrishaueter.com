Here's news: after consulting with people whose opinions I respect, I've 90% decided to take a year off from Columbia after the fall semester.

Why am I doing this? It's for my health.

Results of taking a year off:



	
  * I'll spend January 2012 - January 2013 outside of NYC (I'm considering Chantilly, VA and Austin, TX)

	
  * I'll come back for the spring 2013 semester to complete my degree

	
  * I'll have the freedom to structure my life according to my own desires

	
  * I'll be a working entrepreneur for the next year




I was so excited at the prospect of loving my life again that I made a mind map (right-click and open the image in a new tab to see the full-size version).

I'd love to hear feedback on my ideal day. Did you notice any glaring omissions?
