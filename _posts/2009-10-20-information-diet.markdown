School is intense, and I have plenty of studying to be doing, so I am now beginning a low-information diet.

For the next month, I will only seek new information from the following sources:

1. Personal scripture study / church attendance
2. Conversations with friends and family
3. Textbooks, lectures, etc. related to my courses at Columbia.
4. Chance occurrences.

This diet specifically forbids:
1. Twitter, Facebook, etc.
2. Almost all blogs (excluding Coding Horror)
3. Spending much time working on this blog.

Well, that's that.  I'll be back in a few weeks.
