Well, it's about time I posted again.  I have really good news:

I got engaged!

Just kidding.  The real news is a bit more mundane, but still very exciting, for me at least.  I contacted a large number of website owners with offers to purchase their websites.  One of the owners was not ready to sell his website, but agreed to form a partnership with me in which I would improve the website (focusing on increasing revenue) and we would split the revenue 50/50.

That by itself is not so shabby, but I am an entrepreneur, so I am looking not only for income, but also equity.  So I emailed him last night offering to become a partner not only for website development, but also for the business as a whole.  It was a bit gutsy, but I believe my argument was sound.  Now I am waiting for his response.

This is the most exciting thing I am doing right now.  My classes and the New York nightlife are fun, too, but for the first time, I am actually BEING an entrepreneur and not only talking about it.

I would love to hear your comments!
