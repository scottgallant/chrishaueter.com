I started writing this post as a comment in response to [Stephen Taylor's comment](http://www.chrishaueter.com/unplugging-for-thirty-days/#comment-7) on my last post, but it got pretty long, plus I thought others might be interested to know this.

It's funny that you mention Legend of Dragoon.  I played a lot of video games from about 4th grade through 8th grade, so the summer after 8th grade I was totally engrossed in Legend of Dragoon.  I was a big fan of using the Game Shark and other methods of cheating, despite the fact that using cheats quickly removed all fun from the gameplay.  Well, after school let out for the summer, I began playing nearly non-stop, probably 12 hours a day, at least.  Since I was using cheatcodes, the game slowly became less and less fun, until I realized one morning that I was wasting my life, with nothing to show for the previous two weeks.  I immediately stopped playing video games and have never since had any interest in them whatsoever.  The only exception is Tetris.  I still dig Tetris, but I can only play for about fifteen minutes, and that only every few months.  I would say that eliminating video games increased my happiness at the time.  I have also seen (not so much here at Columbia, but especially in high school) how much of a distraction video games can become if someone does not wisely regulate his or her video game intake.  It really did not matter too much in elementary and middle school, but by the time someone is in high school or college, the time and attention spent on video games can become a significant impediment to fully achieving one's potential.

In response to your statement that you "found no extra happiness or productivity" from reducing time spent on the computer, I will say that I can see your point of view.  Personally speaking, I immensely enjoy the time I spend using the Internet.   Facebook and email are just the start.  What is so engrossing is the information I can find.  ANYTHING.  If I want to learn about something, chances are that, somewhere on the Internet, I can find a well-thought-out, clear delivery of that information.  That simple fact by itself is not only miraculous, but incredibly powerful.  The potential for learning, communicating, socializing, and growing are immense.

The benefit of immediate access to any information comes at a cost, however.  Allowing myself to look up something on the Internet at any time, even in the middle of another task, can be detrimental to my attention span.  This too-often interruption of my tasks puts me in a distracted state where I am unable to concentrate on _anything_.  My studies, homework, and grades suffer.  Distraction is part of the cause, but even that is not all.  Surfing the Internet, like any gratifying activity, can become a habit.  If not controlled or directed, it can begin to take more and more time, until other aspects of life suffer.  I openly admit that I have let this happen to me.  During the previous semester I probably spent 7-10 hours per week on the Internet.

The unfortunate thing is that this is time squandered.  I do not deny the merit of using Facebook, emailing, or doing research online.  Aimless browsing, however, wastes time, concentration, and energy; for me it can decrease both my self-control and sensitivity to the Holy Spirit.  Thus, I stick with the goal I mentioned in the last post.  Perhaps I should refine the goal, though: I do not need to reduce time spent goalfully researching, studying, or communicating using the Internet.  What I will continue to deny place in my life is using the Internet for mindless entertainment.  It is not the place to go when bored.
