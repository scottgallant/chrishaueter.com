Karen dearest,  
  
Ryan Burton visited ASMSA?  Sweet!  I thought he was still in Utahville moving giant farm sprinklers!  Well, good news.  I have my final Bishop interview on Thursday, my Stake President interview on Sunday, and I'll have my papers off by Monday the 17th!  Then I should find out around the 27th where and when I am going for my mission!  I just got back from a farewell for a guy from my ward here in Colorado Springs.   His name is Kyle Jones, and he is leaving Tuesday for the Missionary Training Center, after which he will report to Tacoma, Washington!  I was the official photographer at the farewell, and took around 100 pictures of him with families from our ward and also of people just mingling.  That was fun.  My brother, Chandler, is returning Friday from his mission in Vienna, Austria.  We are going to go camping and do tons of other fun stuff, and I cannot wait to see him again and hang out with him!  He's really going to show me up with his German, though.  When he left, my German was far better, but I have not practiced in two years and he has done nothing but.  Well, holla back; this communication thing you speak of sounds pretty good.  
  
Cheers,  
Chris

I should send Chris a line to say, "hey!" So... this is a line... or well three, to say, "hey!" and I miss you and all that jazz. Just thinking of you. Hope you have a fantastic day/week until next time. (by the way, you should write back and then we could have this weird little thing called communication. It's pretty flippin sweet from what I hear!)
