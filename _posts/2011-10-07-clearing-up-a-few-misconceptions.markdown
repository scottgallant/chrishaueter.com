One of the responses to my recent [Facebook announcement](http://chrishaueter.com/coming-out-responses/) came in the form of the following well-intentioned private message. I appreciate the support and caring this individual has expressed for me, but I'd also like to publicly respond to several points. Here goes:


> Chris,

I saw your post and thought that I would comment on it. I know we didn't get to know each other super well when you were living here in Provo but I feel I knew you well enough to comment.

The reason why I do comment is because I'm not sure if you are receiving any advice from another male member of the church.


He wasn't aware of this, which is fine, but I made the Facebook announcement only after three-and-a-half years of discussing the issue openly and candidly, at first with two of my brothers, then with the bishop of my singles ward, then with my parents, then with my roommates, and then (every several weeks, for a year) with a licensed clinical therapist.


> The advice that I would give is to be careful during these times, I know you have a strong testimony of the gospel, but now that you have publicly made these comments, it could possibly become more difficult to foster or overcome these feelings.


Hmm... does talking openly about having same-gender attraction make it more difficult to overcome?

I'll get to that question, but first I question the claim that I should be trying to "overcome" same-gender attraction. If I had a magic pill that could eliminate my feelings of attraction toward men and replace them with attraction toward women, would I take it? Most likely. Unfortunately, life isn't that simple. My attractions are deeply felt and complex,  just like most men's attractions are toward women. I've spent considerable time in therapy attempting to minimize feelings of same-gender attraction. Although as a result I came to love myself more as God loves me, and stopped feeling ashamed for feelings that are beyond my control, _the_ _actual feelings of same-gender attraction hardly changed at all. _I am _not_ claiming that "overcoming" SGA is impossible (anecdotally, I've heard it is, for _some_ men/women)... but if it _is_ possible for me, it's still not an easy "fix", nor is it quick.

Even if it is possible for me to change my sexual orientation without causing undo psychological harm, should I? In the past I would have immediately answered 'yes', but I no longer see that as the clearly right answer. God _allowed_ me to experience SGA. Why? Perhaps because through this particular challenge/experience, He wants me to learn lessons that I couldn't learn any other way, and become a person that I could not become any other way. For now, I'm not trying to _overcome_, but simply to live the gospel while I continue to experience SGA.

Now back to the point about speaking openly about my same-gender attraction. Does talking about SGA openly make it harder for me to live the gospel? I won't speak for everyone, but in my case, **no**. It was harder to live the gospel when I felt like I was alone; when I felt like I had to hide an important part of myself from others and as a result was not able to connect to them very well. It was harder living the gospel when I felt that a large part of me, a part that was beyond my control, was shameful and taboo and must never be shared with others. Taboo has hurt me, and thousands more LDS men like me, much more than have openness and honest dialogue.


> I'm not here to bash those feelings or to say that they are bad, but they are in fact a temptation that you need to resist, and when publicly displaying your weaknesses can make it more difficult to overcome. If you haven't yet already, I would seek council from the Bishop.


Are feelings of same-gender attraction "a temptation that you need to resist?" No, not necessarily. Obviously, there **are** temptations, such as the temptation to engage in sexual behavior, but not all attractions are temptations. When a man is attracted to a woman, does that always mean he has been tempted? I think not.


> Use your testimony in Christ to make this weakness your strength.

Be careful of the groups that were listed in your post because often times those groups don't have any religious basis and can often lead one astray. Look to the Lord to overcome this temptation and not worldly groups who look to push their agenda and group themselves with others to rationalize that those feelings are okay.


I'm assuming he's referring to [Evergreen International](http://evergreeninternational.org/), [North Star](http://northstarlds.org/), and [Journey Into Manhood](http://www.peoplecanchange.com/jim/).

Please take a moment with me to read from these organizations' mission statements, as published online. First, Evergreen:


> Evergreen International is the most complete resource for Latter-day Saints who experience same-sex attraction. Evergreen is a nonprofit organization that offers help to people who want to diminish their attractions and overcome homosexual behavior. It is also a resource to their loved ones, professional counselors, religious leaders, and friends.

Evergreen is not affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but **we sustain the doctrines and standards of the Church without reservation or exception**. Our Board of Trustees usually includes one or more emeritus General Authorities and we continue to build relationships with Area Presidencies and other Church leaders. Upon request, we provide training to hundreds of stake and ward leaders each year.


Now, let's read about North Star:


> North Star is a place of community for Latter-day Saints dealing with issues surrounding homosexual attraction **who desire to live in harmony with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the values and doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**. The purpose of North Star is to be a spiritually uplifting resource for individuals and families dealing with this complex issue. It is also to empower individuals to help educate themselves, their family, friends, and Church leaders as they strive to become integrated more fully and lovingly into the Church... You are not alone...


Journey Into Manhood, which is not affiliated with the Church (or any religious organization, for that matter), still advocates surrender to a higher power in the process of resolving SGA:


> Journey Into Manhood is a 48-hour immersion in intensive emotional-healing work, designed specifically for men who are self-motivated and serious about resolving unwanted homosexual attractions.

Journey Into Manhood is not a religious retreat, although many men find it spiritually rewarding. Men of all faiths (or no faith) are welcome. We do teach the principle of "surrender" to a Higher Power or Greater Good. But we do not advocate a specific faith, nor will we intentionally challenge your religious beliefs.


None of these groups is sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, true. Clearly, though, they aren't, "worldly groups who look to push their agenda," nor do they aim to "rationalize that those feelings are okay." [Once again, I point out that _the_ _feelings_, in and of themselves, if not "okay," at least aren't _sinful_ or worthy of shame. The [official Church statement on same-gender attraction](http://newsroom.lds.org/official-statement/same-gender-attraction) says as much.]

While I agree with the importance of "Look[ing] to the Lord to overcome," taken in context the implication is that I should look to the Lord _alone_, without the support of others with SGA who are living faithfully. I simply disagree with that. It's a big deal and it is often too much for me to handle alone. I do call on the Lord for help, but He isn't my only source of strength. Others can help, and we should feel free to reach out to others for help in with our life's challenges. Back to the letter:


> As we are not suppose to publicly talk about our sins. I understand that you may want to advise others or perhaps receive some advice yourself but think about this in terms of having immoral thoughts about women. In order to overcome those thoughts you don't talk about them with your friend, you trust in the lord and pray for strength and the ability to control your mind and emotions.


Even if a man without SGA were to pray fervently for strength (and believe me, I have), and constantly "white knuckle" himself into never having immoral thoughts about women, would he still fundamentally be attracted to them? _Yes_. How is this case any different? How is willpower going to change the deeply ingrained attractions and affections of my heart?


> It may be the most difficult thing that you have to overcome, but by calling on the power of the atonement can truly assist you in overcoming this trial.


Yes, the Atonement has, and will continue to be, my greatest source of strength and hope for the future.


> Just be careful man, I write this because I have a great respect for your family. I know your brothers a bit better than you, but I know you all are great people and I wouldn't want to see you go down this road.


I don't quite know what you mean by "down this road," but there isn't anything I've written that is contrary to the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as far as I understand them, nor have I indicated that I plan on choosing a path contrary to the gospel. One of my earlier comments on Facebook should make that clear:


> The reason I'm comfortable with sharing this is because I strive to be firmly grounded in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I don't plan on exploring homosexual relationships, and I would like to eventually marry a woman. I just don't know when that will become a possibility, so until I'm ready for that, I continue to put my faith in Christ and try to remain patient and hopeful.


He closes his letter:


> I don't mean to offend in any way by sending you this letter.

Be strong brother, hold firm in the faith...


This letter didn't offend me; I hope I've made my thoughts on some points sufficiently clear.

I'd love to hear your questions or comments.
