I'm back to school again, and am pretty pleased with how the semester is shaping up.

Best course I am taking: Object-oriented programming with Java.  Yay!

Worst course: Gateway engineering lab.  Freshman have to endure this course almost as a rite of passage.  I'll try to make the best of it.

In other news, I have found an investor who is willing to provide capital (and assume the risk of losing it) for one of my business ideas: buying, renovating, and eventually reselling websites.  Strictly speaking, I don't need an investor, but I would rather have 0% chance of losing money that should be used for tuition, at the expense of 35% of the profit.  After my first successful website sale, I will be able to provide my own capital.

So the real question is: Will I have the time during this semester to learn and do everything necessary to succeed at this?  That is the question I am asking myself.

Any thoughts or comments?  Please share them!
