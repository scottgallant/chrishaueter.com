I've experienced a minor setback.  Usually I set an alarm on my cell phone for the time when I want to wake up, but for my midnight nap last night I used the countdown timer function instead.  What I thought was minutes:seconds was actually hours:minutes, so I set the timer for 20 hours instead of 20 minutes.  
  
As a result, I slept eight hours instead of twenty minutes.  
  
:(  
  
I feel better rested than I did yesterday, but in the long run, this will prolong the transition period, leaving me more tired for longer.  Oh well.  The experiment continues.  I am beginning to enjoy taking naps every four hours.  
  
Yeah, I really have nothing more to say today because I am not feeling polyphasic.  It's more like I had a really good sleep after two days of sleep deprivation....
